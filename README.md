# starter-javafx-kotlin-2022
This is a starter multi-project for the best Intellij+Gradle project for Kotlin and JavaFx in 2022.

* Gradle is 7.4
* OpenJDK is 18.0.1.1
* Kotlin plugin is 1.16.21
* OpenJfx plugin is 0.0.13
* TornadoFx is the 2.0.0 snapshot

This appears to work, tho it is frighteningly difficult to be certain. 

Q: Why is dependency management still an open problem in the year of our Lord 2022?
